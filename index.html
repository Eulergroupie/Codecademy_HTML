        <h1>The Basics of HTML</h1>
        <p> HTML is the skeleton of all web pages. HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language. A markup language is a computer
            language that defines the structure and presentation of raw text. Hypertext is text displayed on a computer or 
            device that provides access to other text through links, also known as hyperlinks. Learning HTML is the first step
            in creating websites.
        </p>
        <h2>Basic Structure</h2>
        <p>HTML is composed of elements. These elements structure the webpage and define its content. The diagram below displays
           an HTML paragraph element. It is made up of an opening tag, the content, and a closing tag. When an element is 
           contained inside another element, it is considered the child of that element. The child element is said to be nested
           inside of the parent element. Since there can be multiple levels of nesting, this analogy can be extended to 
           grandchildren, great-grandchildren, and beyond. The relationship between elements and their ancestor and descendent
           elements is known as hierarchy. Understanding HTML hierarchy is important because child elements can inherit behavior
           and styling from their parent element.

        <h3>A very basic web page takes this form:</h3>
        <p> <strong>
            &lt!DOCTYPE html&gt<br>
            &lthtml&gt<br><br>
            &ltheader&gt<br>
            &lttitle&gtThis text in the tab&lt/title&gt<br>
            &lt/header&gt<br><br>
            &ltbody&gt<br>
            &lth1&gtThis is a main heading&lt/h1&gt<br>
            &ltp&gtThis is in a paragraph&lt/p&gt<br>
            &lth2&gtThis is a smaller header&lt/h2&gt<br>
            &ltp&gt<br>
            This is in a paragraph&ltbr&gt<br>
            Line breaks are made with the single tag &ltbr&gt<br>
            if the paragraph doesn't end it<br>
            &lt/p&gt<br>
            &lt/body&gt<br><br>
            &ltfooter&gt<br>
            &lt/footer&gt<br><br>
            &lt/html&gt
        </strong></p>
        <p> The first html tags indicate what kind of file this is to a browser that displays it.<br>
            The header section generally contains the title and maybe some general information.<br>
            The body contains the content of the web page, the basic structure of which is usually composed of headings and
            paragraphs among other things. Headings are used to title sections and range from large <strong>&lth1&gt</strong> 
            to small <strong>&lth6&gt</strong>.<br>
            The footer often consists of links to other pages, email adresses, and other general info.</p>
        <p> The <strong>&ltdiv&gt&lt/div&gt</strong> tags are often used to "divide" the page into sections.<br>
            If we want to expand an element’s tag, we can do so using an attribute. Attributes are content added to the 
            opening tag of an element and can be used in several different ways, from providing information to changing 
            styling. Attributes are made up of two parts: the name of the attribute, and the value of the attribute. One 
            commonly used attribute is the <em>id</em>. We can use the <em>id</em> attribute to specify different content 
            (such as <strong>&ltdiv&gts</strong>) and is really helpful when you use an element more than once. <em>id</em>s 
            have several different purposes in HTML, but for now, we’ll focus on how they can help us identify content on our 
            page.<br><br>
            <strong>
            &ltdiv id="intro"&gt<br>
            &lth1&gtIntroduction&lt/h1&gt<br>
            &lt/div&gt
            </strong>
        </p>
        <p> <strong>&ltp&gt&lt/p&gt</strong> tags are used to contain blocks (paragraphs) of plain text. <strong>
            &ltspan&gt&lt/span&gt</strong> tags contains short pieces of text or other HTML. They are used to separate small 
            pieces of content that are on the same line as other content. It’s best to use a <strong>&ltspan&gt</strong> element 
            when you want to target a specific piece of content with an <em>id</em> that is inline, or on the same line as other 
            text.</p>
        <h2>Styling Text</h2>
        <p> The <strong>&ltem&gt&lt/em&gt</strong> tags emphasize text (usually <em>italics</em>). <strong>
            &ltstrong&gt&lt/strong&gt</strong> tags produce <strong>bold</strong> text.</p>
        <h2>Lists</h2>
        <p> An unordered list creates a list with bullets. The <strong>&ltul&gt&lt/ul&gt</strong> tags surround the entire 
            list, while each line item uses the <strong>&ltli&gt&lt/li&gt</strong> tags like this:<br><br>
            <strong>
            &ltul&gt<br>
            &ltli&gtLimes&lt/li&gt<br>
            &ltli&gtTortillas&lt/li&gt<br>
            &ltli&gtChicken&lt/li&gt<br>
            &lt/ul&gt<br><br>
            </strong>
            to produce:
            <ul>
                <li>Limes</li>
                <li>Tortillas</li>
                <li>Chicken</li>
            </ul>
            An ordered list is numbered and is created with the same format except for <strong>&ltol&gt&lt/ol&gt</strong> tags.
        </p>
        <h2>Images</h2>
        <p> The <strong>&ltimg&gt</strong> tag allows you to add an image to a web page. Most elements require both opening and 
            closing tags, but the <strong>&ltimg&gt</strong> tag is a self-closing tag. Note that the end of the 
            <strong>&ltimg&gt</strong> tag has a forward slash / before the &gt.<br>
            The <strong>&ltimg&gt</strong> tag has a required attribute called <em>src</em>. The <em>src</em> attribute must be 
            set to the image's source, or the location of the image. The value is often a uniform resource locator (URL) that 
            indicates the web or local address where the image is stored. For example:<br><br>
            <strong>
            &ltimg src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/codecademy-content/courses/web-101/web101-image_brownbear.jpg" /&gt<br><br>
            </strong>
            produces...<br><br>
            <img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/codecademy-content/courses/web-101/web101-image_brownbear.jpg" /><br>
            The <em>alt</em> attribute can be added to the image tag just like the <em>src</em> attribute. The value of 
            <em>alt</em> should be a description of the image.<br><br>
            <strong>
            &ltimg src="file:///C:/Code/sunflowers.jpg" alt="A field of sunflowers" /&gt<br><br>
            </strong>
            The <em>alt</em> attribute serves the following purposes:
            <ul>
                <li>If an image fails to load on a web page, a user can mouse over the area originally intended for the image and
                    read a brief description of the image.</li>
                <li>Visually impaired users often browse the web with the aid of screen reading software. When you include the 
                    <em>alt</em> attribute, the screen reading software can read the image’s description out loud to the visually 
                    impaired user.</li>
                <li>The <em>alt</em> attribute also plays a role in Search Engine Optimization (SEO), because search engines cannot 
                    “see” the images on websites as they crawl the internet. Having descriptive alt attributes can improve the 
                    ranking of your site.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <h2>Videos</h2>
        <p> In addition to images, HTML also supports displaying videos. Like the <strong>&ltimg&gt</strong> tag, the <strong>
            &ltvideo&gt</strong> tag requires a <em>src</em> attribute with a link to the video source. Unlike the <strong>
            &ltimg&gt</strong> tag however, the <strong>&ltvideo&gt</strong> element requires an opening and a closing tag.<br><br>
            <strong>
            &ltvideo src="myVideo.mp4" width="320" height="240" controls&gtVideo not supported&lt/video&gt<br><br>
            </strong>
            After the <em>src</em> attribute, the <em>width</em> and <em>height</em> attributes are used to set the size of the 
            video displayed in the browser. The <em>controls</em> attribute instructs the browser to include basic video controls: 
            pause, play and skip. The text, “Video not supported”, between the opening and closing <strong>&ltvideo&gt</strong> tags 
            will only be displayed if the browser is unable to load the video.
        </p>
        <h2>Structure</h2>
        <p> This is an amazing video from Codecademy (through Youtube), that describes some "best practices" for structuring HTML.<br>
            I added this link by right clicking on the video and selecting <em>Copy embed code</em>.<br>

            Some new tags introduced were:
            <ul>
                <li><strong>&ltheader&gt&lt/header&gt</strong></li>
                <li><strong>&ltnav&gt&lt/nav&gt</strong></li>
                <li><strong>&ltsection&gt&lt/section&gt</strong></li>
                <li><strong>&ltfooter&gt&lt/footer&gt</strong></li>
                <li><strong>&ltsmall&gt&lt/small&gt</strong></li>
