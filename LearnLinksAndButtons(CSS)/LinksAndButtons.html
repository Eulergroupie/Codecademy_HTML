    <h1>Learn Links and Buttons</h1>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Signifiers help a user to interact with a website by showing the user
            what they can interact with (concept of affordances). Showing interactivity
            and clickability through signifiers is a fundamental aspect of user interface
            design.
            </p>
        <h2>Browser Link Styles</h2>
            <p>A <i>user agent stylesheet</i> is a set of default styles used by a Browser
            to provide some level of default behavior for rendering content that helps to
            create a consistent user experience.</p>
            <p>Traditionally, links are differentiated from regular text using blue text 
            and underlines to draw users' attention to their clickability. Clicking will 
            change it to red until the link is visited, at which time it turns purple.
            </p>
<pre>
a {
    color: blue;
    text-decoration: underline;
}</pre>
        <h2>Link Styling</h2>
            <p>The most common signifiers are <i>color</i> and <i>text-decoration</i>, but 
            other possibilities are <i>background-color</i>, <i>font-weight</i>, and 
            <i>border</i>. Link styles should not be replicated in other page text.</p>
            <p>Anchor text itself should be descriptive of the linked resource, not just
            for design, but for usability, accessibility, and SEO.
            </p>
        <h2>Tooltips and Titles</h2>
            <p>Additional context for a link is sometimes useful or necessary as is the 
            case with links represented by images, icons, or other non-text elements. 
            The HTML attribute <i>title</i> is often extremely helpful as additional 
            context or advisory text for clickable elements. Most browsers display the
            text of a <i>title</i> attribute as a tooltip.

        <h2>Hover States and Cursors</h2>
            <p>Hovering over an element can trigger the text color to change with the 
            following basic styling.
            </p>
<pre>
a {
    color: blue;
}
    
a:hover {
    color: orange;
}</pre>
            <p>When hovering over a link, user agent behavior is for the <i>cursor</i> to 
            change to a pointing hand. <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/rendering.html"
            target="_blank" title="Used to develop user agent stylesheets">HTML5 default styles</a>
            </p>
<pre>
a {
    cursor: pointer;
}
</pre>
            <p>Hover state styling should not be relied on to indicate links. One shouldn't be
            expected to scan with a mouse to find links, and mobile doesn't accomodate it.
